As a Marketing director I will use this website to get the results of the clicks so that I can provide more targeted advertisements. 

As a user I am going to click on the items that provide feedback to the company so that I can get more accurate/usable advertisement. 

As a developer I want to create a user friendly application that keeps track of user data based on user clicks so that data can be used for better advertising.
